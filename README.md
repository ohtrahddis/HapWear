## About
### HapWear is a haptic feedback bracelet that communicates with a smartphone to provide hands-free navigation without looking at a map or the phone.
The bracelet contains an LED matrix as well as a number of vibrational motors to create haptic patterns across the wearer's wrist. This creates a hands-free environment where the bracelet seamlessly guides you in the correct direction.
This device communicates with your smartphone over bluetooth to acquire GPS and navigation data and can do so with your phone sitting in your pocket or car.
An arduino microcontroller along with a bluetooth module control the motors and communicate with the smartphone, creating a stand-alone, battery powered device.

Possible uses include: 
  * Navigation for blind users 
  * Turn by turn instructions for bike riders
  * Directions while running, jogging, driving, and much more
